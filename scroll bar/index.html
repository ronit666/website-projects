            Computers and electronics play an enormous role in today's society, 
            impacting everything from communication and medicine to science.
            Although computers are typically viewed as a modern invention involving electronics,
            computing predates the use of electrical devices. The ancient abacus was perhaps the first digital computing device. 
            Analog computing dates back several millennia as primitive computing devices were used as early as the ancient Greeks and Romans, 
            the most known complex of which being the Antikythera mechanism. Later devices such as the castle clock (1206), 
            slide rule (c. 1624) and Babbage's Difference Engine (1822) are other examples of early mechanical analog computers.
            The introduction of electric power in the 19th century led to the rise of electrical and hybrid electro-mechanical devices to carry out both digital (Hollerith punch-card machine) and 
            analog (Bush’s differential analyzer) calculation. Telephone switching came to be based on this technology,
            which led to the development of machines that we would recognize as early computers.
            The presentation of the Edison Effect in 1885 provided the theoretical background for electronic devices. Originally in the form of vacuum tubes
            electronic components were rapidly integrated into electric devices, revolutionizing radio and later television. It was in computers however,
            where the full impact of electronics was felt. Analog computers used to calculate ballistics were crucial to the outcome of World War II, and the Colossus and the ENIAC, 
            the two earliest electronic digital computers, were developed during the war.
            With the invention of solid-state electronics, the transistor and ultimately the integrated circuit,
            computers would become much smaller and eventually affordable for the average consumer. 
            Today “computers” are present in nearly every aspect of everyday life, from watches to automobiles.
            The computer science part gives a engineer much needed wisdom on how software makes computer system run and perform tasks. 
            There are a few different types of employers computer engineers could work for today.
            The first is for a major computer company actually designing whole computer systems for say Compaq or Macintosh. Then there are the type that works for computer components such as peripheral systems and microchips such as Intel. 
            Then there are the engineers that design everyday electronic components such as bank machines and cell phones.
            The job outlook of computer engineering is very good. More and more computer systems are being created every day and the demand for computer engineers is just going to keep on growing.
            For example Chris Kolnik (who is- studying to become a computer engineer) says that there is no end in sight to the growth the computer industry.
            Some advantages of being a computer engineer is that you use your creativity when working on a project and can express yourself through the computer.
            Another advantage is the good pay, it is one of the highest paying fields straight out of college. 
            Their are some disadvantages also like working at a computer all day and being inside the whole time.
            Another disadvantage is working on the same project for a long time and that can get boring sometimes if you don’t have a lot of patients. 
            I want to be a computer engineer cause I think that computers are very interesting machines and they are the wave of the future.
            I also like programming computers and making computer games and so forth. 
            I would like to be a computer engineer mainly cause I want to do something on the cutting edge of technology and computers are the way to go.
            Short Essay on Computer Engineering
            Article shared by 
            Computer engineering is a relatively new field of engineering and is one of the fastest growing fields today. 
            Computer engineering is one of today’s most technologically based jobs.
            The field of computer engineering combines the knowledge of electrical engineering and computer science to create advanced computer systems. 
            Computer engineering involves the process of designing and manufacturing computer central processors,
            memory systems, central processing units, and of peripheral devices.
            Computer engineers work with CAD(computer aided design) programs and different computer languages so they can create and program computer systems.
